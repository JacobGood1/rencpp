The Ren Workbench is only temporarily being managed inside the rencpp repository until it gets moved into one of its own.  Development of that project will be under a different license (GPLv3).

Currently it is being studied as a case of how full-fledged and viable the rencpp API is when being beaten on in a real-world situation.
