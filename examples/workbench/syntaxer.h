//
// The journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step.  Rather than tackle
// syntax highlighting immediately, let's start with a thought experiment about
// merely being able to double click and have a range calculated for a token.
// So if | represents your cursor and you had:
//
//     print {Hello| World}
//
// Then the offset would realize you wanted to select from the opening curly
// brace to the closing curly brace, vs merely selecting hello (as a default
// text edit might.)
//
// This very simple example offers a chance to start thinking about most of
// the "big" issues of threading, when you are to try using the Ren runtime
// to answer such questions.  Because you must be able to safely handle a
// LOAD or TRANSCODE of the buffer while an evaluation is going on in the
// console.  (A user can still select while a command is running, can't they?)
//
// Right now, "Syntaxer" does not need to speak in the QTextEdit vernacular; 
// we just extract buffers of interest out and call it.
